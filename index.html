      <h1>This is a <span class="insult" data-letter="MF"></span> website.</h1>
      <p>And it's <span class="insult" data-letter="F"></span> perfect.</p>
      <h2>Seriously, what the <span class="insult" data-letter="F"></span>
        else do you want?</h2>
      <p>You probably build websites and think your
        <span class="insult" data-letter="S"></span> is special.
      You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going
      to get you some <span class="insult" data-letter="F"></span>
      Awwward banner you can glue to the top
      corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file
      and 83 polyfills give IE7 a <span class="insult" data-letter="A"></span>
      because it finally has box-shadow.
      Wrong, <span class="insult" data-letter="MF"></span>.
      Let me describe your perfect-ass website:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><span class="insult" data-letter="S"></span>'s
          lightweight and loads fast</li>
        <li>Fits on all your
          <span class="insult" data-letter="S"></span> screens</li>
        <li>Looks the same in all your
          <span class="insult" data-letter="S"></span> browsers</li>
        <li>The <span class="insult" data-letter="MF"></span>'s accessible to every
          <span class="insult" data-letter="A"></span> that visits your site</li>
        <li>SHOWER's legible and gets your
          <span class="insult" data-letter="F"></span> point across
        (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Well guess what, <span class="insult" data-letter="MF"></span>:</h3>
      <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this
        <span class="insult" data-letter="S"></span>.
      It's a <span class="insult" data-letter="MF"></span> website.
      Why the <span class="insult" data-letter="F"></span> do you need
      to animate a <span class="insult" data-letter="F"></span>
      trendy-ass banner flag when I hover over
      that useless piece of <span class="insult" data-letter="S"></span>?
      You spent hours on it and added
      80 kilobytes to your <span class="insult" data-letter="F"></span> site,
      and some <span class="insult" data-letter="MF"></span>
      jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers
      will never see that <span class="insult" data-letter="S"></span>.
      Not to mention blind people
      will never see that <span class="insult" data-letter="S"></span>,
      but they don't see any of your
      <span class="insult" data-letter="S"></span>
      <span class="insult" data-letter="S"></span>.</p>

      <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>

      <h2>It's <span class="insult" data-letter="F"></span> lightweight</h2>
      <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook
      logo on your <span class="insult" data-letter="F"></span> Wordpress site.
      Did you seriously load 100kb
      of jQuery UI just so you could animate the
      <span class="insult" data-letter="F"></span> background
      color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a
      <span class="insult" data-letter="S"></span> webfont
      just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site?
      You piece of <span class="insult" data-letter="S"></span>.</p>

      <h2>It's responsive</h2>
      <p>You <span class="insult" data-letter="A"></span>.
        You thought you needed media queries to be responsive,
      but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever
      <span class="insult" data-letter="MF"></span>
      screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac
      or a <span class="insult" data-letter="MF"></span> Tamagotchi.</p>

      <h2>It <span class="insult" data-letter="F"></span> works</h2>
      <p>Look at this <span class="insult" data-letter="S"></span>.
        You can read it ... that is, if you can read,
      <span class="insult" data-letter="MF"></span>.
      It makes sense. It has <span class="insult" data-letter="MF"></span> hierarchy.
      It's using HTML5 tags so you and your
      <span class="insult" data-letter="A"></span> browser know what
      the <span class="insult" data-letter="F"></span>'s in this
      <span class="insult" data-letter="F"></span> site. That's semantics,
      <span class="insult" data-letter="MF"></span>.</p>

      <p>It has content on the <span class="insult" data-letter="F"></span> screen.
        Your site has three bylines
      and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7
      full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me
      how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>

      <p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this
        <span class="insult" data-letter="MF"></span> in IE6.
      I <span class="insult" data-letter="F"></span> dare you.</p>

      <h2>This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h2>
      <p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea
      what his true natural state is, you have no
      <span class="insult" data-letter="F"></span> idea what a website is.
      All you have ever seen are S skeuomorphic B of
      what should be text communicating a F message.
      This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's F beautiful.</p>

      <h3>Yes, this is F satire, you F</h3>
      <p>I'm not actually saying your S site should look like this.
      What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites
      are ones we create ourselves. Websites aren't broken by default,
      they are functional, high-performing, and accessible.
      You break them. You S-of-a-B.</p>
